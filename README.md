_Restroom Occupancy SEnsor_

This is an internal application for use with the [Spark Core](https://www.spark.io/).

When the necessary functions (lightIsOn and doorIsClosed) are fulfilled by external sensors,
this application keeps track of whether or not the restroom is occupied. When combined with
the AngularJS app in index.html, this provides a convenient web-based restroom status indicator.
